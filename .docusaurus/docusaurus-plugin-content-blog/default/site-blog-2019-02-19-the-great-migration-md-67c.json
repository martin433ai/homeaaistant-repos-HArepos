  "description": "Home Assistant is based around components. One type of components is the one that provide an entity abstraction for a type of device, like lights, switches or media players. Historically, to integrate with these abstractions, you would create a platform for this component. If the light component would be light/, the integration would create its platform as light/hue.py. This way, all logic for the lights was kept together.",
