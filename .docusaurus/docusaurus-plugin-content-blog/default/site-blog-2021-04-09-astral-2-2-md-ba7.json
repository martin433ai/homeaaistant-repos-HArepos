  "description": "We recently merged a pull request to upgrade the astral library version used in Home Assistant Core to version 2.2. This will be released with Home Assistant 2021.5. This is a major version bump of Astral which includes some breaking changes, this caused us to update our built-in helpers and integrations that depend on astral. This has resulted in a couple of breaking changes to our sun helpers.",
