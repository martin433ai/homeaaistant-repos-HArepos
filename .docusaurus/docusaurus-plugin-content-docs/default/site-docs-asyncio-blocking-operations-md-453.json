  "description": "When writing asyncio code, it's essential to ensure that all blocking operations are done in a separate thread. If blocking operations happen in the event loop, nothing else can run until the operation is complete. For this reason, no blocking operations happen in the event loop, as the entire system will stall for the duration of the blocking operation.",
