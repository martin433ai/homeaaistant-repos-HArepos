  "description": "Home Assistant can interact with large language models (LLMs). By exposing a Home Assistant API to an LLM, the LLM can fetch data or control Home Assistant to better assist the user. Home Assistant comes with a built-in LLM API, but custom integrations can register their own to provide more advanced functionality.",
